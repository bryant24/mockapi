              I'm baking cupcakes,
              <br />
              but I've run out of sugar. Would you please spare me a spoonful?
              <br />
              Sure, I'll fetch you a packet.
              <br />
              Question,
              <br />
              what will the woman offer to the man?
              <br />
              2.
              <br />
              Haven't seen the dog for two days.
              <br />
              I don't know if anything terrible has happened to it.
              <br />
              We'd better prepare for the worst
              <br />
              question.
              <br />
              How does the woman most probably feel
              <br />
              3.

              Can you recommend something that a schoolboy of seven or eight
              will really like?
              <br />
              I'd suggest this toy train, sir.
              <br />
              This new brand is popular these days.
              <br />
              Question,
              <br />
              what is the man most probably doing
              <br />
              4.
              <br />
              I put my note book on the bench a while ago,
              <br />
              but now it's gone.
              <br />
              Well, you should have kept an eye on it.
              <br />
